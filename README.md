# myCOVIDcli

Hi!
I'm pretty new to Go, but I decided to use some of my downtime in this terrible situation to be able to see a 
nice printout of the places I'm monitoring from the CLI.

Updates:

1) Rendering code significantly improved/fixed due to formatting changes
2) Updated for go 1.16
3) improved handling of location data
4) Go vendoring :-)


Please be respectful of the other connected projects!
